# Agents

Simple Python app that would allow you to use LLMs to process single entries of large datasets, e.g. go through a list of words and ask for translation in multiple languages.
This app would be able to go either one by one or chunk the items and send them asynch to an LLM API to be processed.
Once the processing is done, put the output together and save.
